To effectively debug this, follow these steps:

1. **Clean the project:**  Remove the build cache to eliminate potential inconsistencies.
   ```bash
   expo prebuild --clean
   ```
2. **Check for image issues:** Ensure all images are correctly sized, formatted, and named.  Avoid using unusual characters in file names.  Use proper density suffixes (e.g., `image@2x.png`)
3. **Inspect XML layouts:** Verify all XML layout files for correct syntax and any possible errors.
4. **Examine AndroidManifest.xml:** Double-check for any inconsistencies or missing elements in this file. 
5. **Check dependencies:** Review your `package.json` and ensure there are no conflicting dependencies. Consider updating dependencies to the latest versions.
6. **Simplify your project:** Create a minimal, reproducible example to isolate the issue.  If possible, start a new Expo project and gradually add components to pinpoint the source of the problem.
7. **Review build logs:** Look carefully at the full error output from the `expo build:android` command. The error messages often provide clues, even if initially they appear vague.  Look for specific file names or error codes to narrow down the search.
8. **Check for duplicate resource names:** Carefully review your project for any resources (images, drawables, etc.) that might share the same name.  This can often lead to build errors.

If the issue persists, refer to Expo's documentation and community forums for further assistance.  Provide detailed logs and information about your project to aid in finding a solution.

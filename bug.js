This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The error message is vague, and might look something like this:

```
Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugResources'.
> A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.Workers$ActionFacade
   > Android resource linking failed
     > ... More error messages ...
```

The root cause is often related to issues within your project's resources (images, XML layouts, etc.) or inconsistencies in your AndroidManifest.xml file.  Sometimes, it's due to problems with dependencies or build configurations that are not immediately obvious.
